# DiabetesPrediction

This project implements a diabetes prediction system using machine learning techniques. It consists of Python code that preprocesses the data, trains a TensorFlow model, evaluates its performance, and visualizes the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes_prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd diabetes_prediction
Ensure your dataset (diabetes.csv) is in the same directory as the Python files.
Run the main script:


python diabetes_prediction.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the TensorFlow model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.

Project Structure
diabetes.csv: Dataset containing diabetes-related features and outcomes.
diabetes_prediction.py: Main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
requirements.txt: File listing all required dependencies for the project.
